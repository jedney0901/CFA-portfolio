          This project presented my first real opportunity to work on a large scale application using a two market system. The core concept behind this was to build a system based on one goal: to make tradies business viable through the digital world. I was required as part of the marketing team which allowed me to understand and discover different approached to building the app.</p>
          As there are a number hell of organisations which offer basic similar services we broke down our product by the target audience - customers, tradies and misc. Customer side was fairly simple as this runs on a similar model that other organisations currrently employ and works well. The second element is based around tradies and what their current issues are with the services currently available. We then separated the core product concept, the innovational elements and then the extra special add-ons for the app.

            As part of what we developed for this client, we could see that they had a number of 3rd party systems which they needed to integrate for this to be valuable to them. As we were in the process of developing our own backend system for client sites we used this as a test case to understand core requirements and the level of integration required for different use cases. This site was built around bootstrap utilising PHP and JS to manage the different elements in the system. The key requirements outlined in the brief for this site was to be able to:
            <ul>
              <li>- Measure their CTR and interactionss witht their audience</li>
              <li>- Integrate with CRMs, internal processe</li>
              <li>- Include an easy to manage backend which they could update when and where they needed to.</li>
