# README

Welcome to my portfolio README, this document will run you through the entire process for developing my portfolio site including creative concepts, wireframes and how my concepts changed over development. As an FYI, this will be something I continue to work on over the coming weeks in the lead up to me finishing my course and becoming a full stack developer.

This site runs on the rails infrastructure which was my first time using something like this, there was a bit of a steep learning curve as I had to grasp the file structures and the underlying concepts which tie the system together.Tying this in using HTML and CSS was an easy concept though when it came to Javascript I didn't have much experience to draw on to help me implement some concepts:

Key features:
 - Smooth scroll: This took a bit of tinkering but was relatively easy to install once I understood how to implement it in with the rails framework.
 
 - Overlays: The overlays took a bit of time as I hadn't manage to achieve something on that scale. Using Flexbox and Bootstrap infrastucture made it a lot easier once I had figured out the different formatting classes required. I think there is a lot more work I can do with these to get them up to scratch.
 
 - Bootstrap: This was my first project using Bootstrap and took a lot of googling and reading up on documentation to fully understand the different functionality I can use with it. As part of my knowledge building I will continue to use bootstrap and then look at other formats to see how their functionality and structure differs to suit my projects needs.
 
 - Morph Buttons: I wanted to take a minimal approach to the design because it's never a good idea to inundate people with information that they never asked for. I looked at a few different sets of morph buttons but settled on using Flickities version which helped me showcase different information in different ways. I settled on a pretty straightforward layout but as I continue to work on having this finalised I will explore different formats and settings to help improve my CSS and JS skills.
 
# Design and Concepting

Looking at my original designs and final designs I came to realise that there was going to need to be a significant reduction in the level of functionality due to time and skill constraints. I worked through originally going through and building out my mood board and got a pretty good understanding of what the theme was going to be based around and how I could pull this together. Unfortunately I couldn't access my original wireframes as they wanted to charge me $15 to continue so I decided to just re-do them based on my memory.

You can see the original drawings here:

Here are the digital wireframes that I did:

# Design Summary:

The design I based on originally was based on my travels around Central and South America last year which actually helped inspire my need to change what I was doing at home and with my life. As you can see the original designs had a lot more design variables to include but would have required a much greater code understanding which I will continue to evolve over the next few months. For the moment I have settled on a key concept: To showcase my works through in a professional manner and then my contact me CTA to showcase the relaxe side of my life. The overall design was very relaxed using a standard base colour of #5ABDAE (Puerto Rico) and then incorporating the imagery which I sourced from Pexels and imagebay.

# Future Development

In the future there are a number of things I would like to incorporate both into the design and development of my portfolio, some of these ideas include:

- A blog/gallery talking about where I am currently working and what I am working on.
- A travel gallery showcasing photos.
- Integrating old photos from my travels and using JS and CSS to bring these to life.
- Incorporating my Github and other social media platforms as I start to develop these. Currently I was not really comfortable with putting these onto here but as I become more proficient using these I will start to incorpoate them.

# Problems I encountered

I found that I had a lot of issues with understanding JS and incorporating it into my site due to my limited prior knowledge. In the end I had to take a lot of time to run through the different frameworks I was trying to use and then reverse engineering them which didn't always go to plan and resulted in me breaking a few things. I also struggled with the Bootstrap forms which I will update over the next few weeks.
